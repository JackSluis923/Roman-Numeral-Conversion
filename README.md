# Roman-Numeral-Conversion
Code for converting between roman numerals -> arabic numbers and vice versa. Code runs in a python shell. Have fun :). 

NOTE: conversion from roman -> arabic assumes that the general syntax of roman numerals is followed: highest to lowest values from left to right and subtractive rule is applied (Ex. IX = 9 b/c 10-1 = 9). The code checks for if there are more than 3 instances of any numeral and if the number of specific numerals doesn't exceed a certain value, but the two requirements above need to be known beforehand.
